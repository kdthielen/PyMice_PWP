# PyMice_PWP

Model setup within PyMice PWP is that of https://ueaeprints.uea.ac.uk/59385/1/2016BiddleLCPhD.pdf
cite as - Biddle, Louise (2016) Identifying Glacial Meltwater in the Amundsen Sea. Doctoral thesis, University of East Anglia.

Included physics in early versions (not v3) are - simple thermodynamic sea ice coverage (latent heat exchange with bulk ML, and albedo for radiation) 
on top of a bulk mixed layer model including Krauss turner Paramaterizations and PWP bulk and gradient richardson number mixing criteria. 


v3 includes petty et al 2014 sea ice physics and a paramaterziation of ekman pumping.
